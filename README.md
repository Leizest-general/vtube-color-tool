# VTubeStudio Recolor Tool with Grouping

A safe and standalone desktop tool that allows VTubeStudio users to:
- View all available ArtMesh layers
- Organize layers into custom-named color groups
- Recolor entire groups with a single color pick
- Save and load groups to reuse across sessions

## 🔒 Safety and Anonymity
This app is designed with streamer safety in mind:
- **No Internet access**: It communicates only locally with VTubeStudio via its official WebSocket API.
- **No telemetry, logging, or account links**.
- **No external dependencies or installation** required for end-users (provided as a single `.exe`).

---

## 📦 Features
- List and filter ArtMeshes from the currently loaded model
- Create named groups (e.g., `hair`, `eyes`, `accessories`)
- Recolor an entire group at once with a color picker
- Save/load groups using `artmesh_groups.json`
